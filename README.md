# hog-pca-svm
# a simple preject for human detection using hog detector and svm. To compare the accuracy and speed between hog and hog-pca, train_pca_svm/test_pca_svm/test_pca_result are presented.
# The operating sequence is: extract_features -> train_svm -> detector / detector_result 
# or with extract_features -> train_pca_svm -> test_pca_svm / test_pca_result if you want to use hog-pca
# the code is still editing...
